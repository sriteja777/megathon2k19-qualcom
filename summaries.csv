"Iris recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation
attacks where an adversary employs artifacts such as 2D
prints of the eye, plastic eyes, and cosmetic contact lenses
to obfuscate their own identity or to spoof the identity of
another subject. In this work, we design a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) architecture for presentation attack
detection, that is observed to have good cross-dataset gen-
eralization capability. The salient features of the proposed
approach include: (a) the use of the pre-normalized iris
rather than the normalized iris, thereby avoiding spatial in-
formation loss; (b) the tessellation of the iris region into
overlapping patches to enable data augmentation as well
as to learn features that are location agnostic; (c) fusion
of information across patches to enhance detection accu-
racy; (d) incorporating a “segmentation mask” in order
to automatically learn the relative importance of the pupil
and iris regions; (e) generation of a “heat map” that dis-
plays patch-wise presentation attack information, thereby
accounting for artifacts that may impact only a small por-
tion of the iris region. Experiments confirm the efficacy of
the proposed approach."
"Human iris is considered a reliable and accurate modal-
ity for biometric recognition due to its unique texture in-
formation. However, similar to other biometric modalities,
iris recognition systems are also vulnerable to presentation
attacks (commonly called spoofing) that attempt to conceal
or impersonate identity. Examples of typical iris spoofing
attacks are printed iris images, textured contact lenses, and
synthetic creation of iris images. It is critical to note that
majority of the algorithms proposed in the literature are
trained to handle a specific type of spoofing attack. These
algorithms usually perform very well on that particular at-
tack. However, in real-world applications, an attacker may
perform different spoofing attacks. In such a case, the prob-
lem becomes more challenging due to inherent variations in
different attacks. In this paper, we focus on a medley of iris
spoofing attacks and present a unified framework for detect-
ing such attacks. We propose a novel structural and textural
feature based iris spoofing detection framework (DESIST).
Multi-order dense Zernike moments are calculated across
the iris image which encode variations in structure of the
iris image. Local Binary Pattern with Variance (LBPV) is
utilized for representing textural changes in a spoofed iris
image. The highest classification accuracy of 82.20% is ob-
served by the proposed framework for detecting normal and
spoofed iris images on a combined iris spoofing database."
"Abstract—Human iris contains rich textural information
which serves as the key information for biometric identifications.
It is very unique and one of the most accurate biometric
modalities. However, spoofing techniques can be used to obfuscate
or impersonate identities and increase the risk of false acceptance
or false rejection. This paper revisits iris recognition with spoofing
attacks and analyzes their effect on the recognition performance.
Specifically, print attack with contact lens variations is used as
the spoofing mechanism. It is observed that print attack and
contact lens, individually and in conjunction, can significantly
change the inter-personal and intra-personal distributions and
thereby increase the possibility to deceive the iris recognition
systems. The paper also presents the IIITD iris spoofing database,
which contains over 4800 iris images pertaining to over 100
individuals with variations due to contact lens, sensor, and print
attack. Finally, the paper also shows that cost effective descriptor
approaches may help in counter-measuring spooking attacks."

"Abstract.In operations of increasingly complex telecommunication networks,characterization of a system state and choosing optimal operation in it are chal-lenges. One possible approach is to utilize statistical and uncertain information inthe network management. This paper gives an overview of our work in which aMarkov Logic Network model (MLN) is used for mobile network analysis withan RDF-based faceted search interface to monitor and control the behavior of theMLN reasoner. Our experiments, based on a prototype implementation, indicatethat the combination of MLN and semantic web technologies can be effectivelyutilized in network status characterization, optimization and visualization"
"ABSTRACT We focus on the problem of designing a 5G network architecture to provide coverage in rural
areas. The proposed architecture is composed of 5G Base Stations carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),
and supported by ground sites interconnected through optical fiber links. We also consider the dimensioning of
each site in terms of the number of Solar Panels (SPs) and batteries. We then formulate the problem of cost
minimization of the aforementioned architecture, by considering: i) the cost for installing the sites, ii) the costs
for installing the SPs and the batteries in each site, iii) the costs for installing the optical fiber links between
the installed sites, and iv) the scheduling of the UAVs to serve the rural areas. Our results, obtained over a
representative scenario, reveal that the proposed solution is effective in limiting the total costs, while being able
to ensure the coverage over the rural areas.
